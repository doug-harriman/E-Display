# Electronic Image Display Server

Image server for remote electronic displays such as a Kindle.

![Kindles](doc/kindles.jpg)

## Motivation

This project was motivated by two desires:
1. To have a nice display of my work calendar on my desk, available at a glance without having to open up Outlook.  
2. To learn about web programming via Python.  

I know there's a lot of stuff here that could be greatly improved.  Please submit pull requests if you'd like to help.

## Key System Features

* Image generation performed on server to keep display device code as simple as possible.  This also allows for easy updates to the display without having to update the device.
* Server code constructed to support multiple display devices, so only a single server is needed.
* Display device can request sleep time from server, so that it can go into low power mode.  This allows the server to have complex logic to determine sleep duration.
    * Images are be pre-generated just ahead of wake time so that they're ready without wait mimimizing device battery usage.
* Display device can send basic state information (battery state of charge and local temperature) to server which is stored in an [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.  State information can then be used for image generation.
* Server code constructed to support plugins, so features can be added easily, and auto-discovered.

### Feature Details
* High-res image generation via [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
* Reusable image header and footer.
    * Header
        * Current day of week, month and date.
        * Battery state of charge.
    * Footer
        * Last update time (last time image was generated on server).
        * Device IP address.
        * Device name.
* Weather
    * Query weather forecast from USA National Weather Service.
    * Map weather forecast to icons.
* Google Calendar
    * Query events
    * Generate one week calendar image.
* Microsoft Outlook 365 Calendar
    * Query events
    * Generate hour by hour event image for the current day.
    * Display hour by hour weather forecast.
* Display properties for Kindle Paperwhite
    * Screen resolution & size
    * Color maps (grayscale)
    * Fonts
* HTTP Post to MQTT Bridge
    * Post state information to MQTT broker.
    * Keeps device software simple.  MQTT data stream without adding MQTT client to device.
    * Additional small MQTT process to push MQTT data to Influx DB.
* Server software updates via `git pull` from web server.

## Installation

* `sudo apt install libvips`
    * [PyVips](https://libvips.github.io/pyvips/index.html) to load and render SVG into Pillow images.
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` (in server directory)

## Configuration

* Copy `google-credentials.json` and `google-token.json` to server.
* Google Calendar
    * When token expires the token file will be deleted if it cannot be refreshed.
    * Manually run the `calendar_google.py` script.
    * Follow the link it provides & confirm access.
    * `google-token.json` will be created.

## Run

```bash
cd server
./serve.sh
```

## Next Tasks

- [ ] Server: Family calendar image weather added
- [ ] Server: Review TODO's
- [ ] Server: Retrieve google cal events with async to speed up download of multiple calendars.
    - Google cal asyncio: https://pypi.org/project/aiogc/
    - Gathering results: https://superfastpython.com/asyncio-gather/#:~:text=main%20done-,Example%20of%20gather()%20With%20Return%20Values,-We%20may%20execute
- [ ] Server: Log to file. 
- [ ] Server: renderer base should accept a layout parameter (landscape, portrait) and then manage resolution and image rotation internally.
- [ ] Server: Containerize to Docker.  
- [ ] Server: Make MQTT2InfluxDB a daemon and run on container.
- [ ] Server: Icon updates.
    - Would be nice to have a battery outline icon to better match the weather icons.
    - During initial icon search, had trouble finding good SVG sets.  After battery icon was implemented found [Ic√¥nes](https://icones.js.org/), which has a lot of really good looking options.  
        - From there, these look like good battery icon options:
