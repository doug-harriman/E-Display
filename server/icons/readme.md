# Weather Icons

A JSON description of the different forecast descriptions can be found at: [https://www.weather.gov/forecast-icons](https://www.weather.gov/forecast-icons). This directory contains the icons for use with those forecasts, as provided by the public API.

The icons used for weather are maintained by Erik Flowers.  An overview of the icons available is available on his [github.io](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/), and the icons can be found in the `svg` directory of his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons).  The file `weather-icons-map.json` provides the mapping from weather forecast designator to SVG file name.

That repository is a fork of google's Material Design Icon repository at: https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/.
